# WordCloud

This project involves creating a `WordCloudComponent` that visualizes words and their frequencies as a word cloud. It dynamically adjusts font sizes and weights based on word frequency, and can handle responsive design.

## Features

- **Dynamic Font Sizing**: Font size is adjusted based on word frequency.
- **Customizable Font Weights**: Adjusts the weight of the font dynamically.
- **Word Display Limit**: Limits the display to a maximum number of words.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to the screen size and resolution.

## Setup

To set up the project, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies.
